    //Here I leave the rough logic to implement later.
    //First, we will need to implement a waitingCustomers queue, where we add customers once they
    //arrive, and remove them once they get their food served. We will also need to implement the
    //waiters' queue, where we add waiters once they become idle, and remove when a task is assigned.
    //Waiters might choose the ready steaks randomly or in a queue, this will be handled in waiters and
    //servicetable classes as I did in fridge, stove or servicetable interactions.
